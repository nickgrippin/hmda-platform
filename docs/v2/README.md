# The HMDA Platform

## This project is a work in progress

Information contained in this repository should be considered provisional and a work in progress, and not the final implementation for the HMDA Platform, unless otherwise indicated.


## Dependencies

### Java 9 SDK

The HMDA Platform runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and requires the Java 9 JDK to build and run the project. This project is currently being built and tested on [Oracle JDK 9](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). See [Oracle's JDK Install Overview](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html) for install instructions.

The HMDA Platform should also run on JDK 8.

### Scala

The HMDA Platform is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). To build it, you will need to [download](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/) and [install](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html) Scala 2.12.x

In addition, you'll need Scala's interactive build tool [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/). Please refer to sbt's [installation instructions](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html) to get started.

## Project structure

The HMDA Platform is divided into individual projects, each responsible for a subset of the functionality, as follows:

### hmda-platform

This is the main filing application, exposing the APIs necessary to upload, validate and store HMDA files. 

### check-digit 

Microservice that exposes functionality to create a check digit from a loan id, and to validate `Univeral Loan Identifiers` 


## Building and Running

### Running from the SBT prompt

* To run the project from the `SBT` prompt for development purposes, issue the following commands on a terminal:

```shell
$ sbt
sbt:root> project hmda-platform
sbt:hmda-platform> reStart
```


### Building and runnint the .jar

* To build JVM artifacts, from the sbt prompt first choose the project you want to build and use the assembly command:

```shell
$ sbt
sbt:root> project check-digit
sbt:check-digit>assembly
```
This task will create a `fat jar`, which can be executed on any `JDK9` compliant `JVM`:

`java -jar target/scala-2.12/check-digit.jar`

### Building and running the Docker image

* To build a `Docker` image that runs the `hmda-platform` as a single node cluster, from the sbt prompt:

```shell
$sbt
sbt:root> project hmda-platform
sbt:hmda-platform> docker:publishLocal
```
This task will create a `Docker` image. To run a container with the `HMDA Platform` filing application as a single node cluster:

`docker run --rm -ti -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 8082:8082 -p 19999:19999 hmda/hmda-platform` 

The same approach can be followed to build and run Docker containers for the other microservices that form the HMDA Platform

### Running the application in clustered mode (mesos)

* The script in the [mesos](../../mesos) folder describes the deployment through [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) on a DCOS / Mesos cluster.

For a 3 node cluster deployed through the [DC/OS CLI](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.10/cli/), the following command can be used:

```shell
dcos marathon app add mesos/hmda-platform-host-mode.json
```

For more details, please refer to the [Marathon Documentation](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/)
